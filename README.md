# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Camphul

I'm a software engineer who's interested in:
- Backend (java, kotlin, spring, golang, etc...)
- Frontend (typescript, react, tailwindcss, node, etc...)
- DevOps (github actions, ci/cd, terraform, pulumi, etc...)
- Kubernetes (I am a KCD organizer myself!)
- Everything around identity, authentication, authorization (OIDC, Oauth2 mTLS, etc...)

Have a look at [my website](https://logicshift.nl) or [my GitHub organization](https://github.com/Logic-Shift)
